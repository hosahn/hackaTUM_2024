## Inspiration
Newsrooms are drowning in data, making it hard to focus on stories that matter. We simplify this chaos and empower storytellers with AI-driven tools to find and deliver impactful, trustworthy news.

## What it does
HeadlineHunter scans and analyzes RSS feeds in real-time, finding stories that are relevant, and provides summaries and actionable insights. It's a tool for authors and newsrooms to save time and focus on telling better stories.

## How we built it
- Node.js and Typescript based Backend.
- React for a beautiful dashboard to give authors more control.
